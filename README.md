# News Explorer - Frontend

This is a repository for the News Explorer project, a React application that allows users to search for articles by keyword using this [News API](https://newsapi.org).

The frontend has two main features:

1. When the user enters a keyword in the search bar, the website sends a request to the News API service, finds all relevant articles from the last week, and displays them on the page.
2. It displays all articles a user saves on a separate page (a protected route).

The design is implemented according to the ðŸŽ¨ [Figma design specification for News Explorer](https://www.figma.com/file/3ottwMEhlBt95Dbn8dw1NH/Your-Final-Project?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=n8iPbRbVKSAS2dCI-0)
